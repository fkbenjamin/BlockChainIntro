# An Introduction into Blockchain
I created this repository in order to explain the basics of blockchain to friends and family. If you have any comments, if I explained something wrong or if you just want to say "Hi", just send me an email to flo.liss@gmail.com

# Abbreviations
I will use the following abbreviations:

- **BC** - *Blockchain*
- **BTC** - *Bitcoin (Currency)*
- **ETH** - *Ether (Currency)*
- **PoW** - *Proof of Work*

# The blockchain - A distributed database
The financial crisis of 2007â€“2008, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008] The financial crisis not only ruined the lives of many people world wide it also damaged people's trust in banks. It's probably no incident that shortly after the peak of this financial crisis, a man with the pseudonym *Satoshi Nakamoto* published a white paper on the first blockchain ever - **Bitcoin**. 

The protocol of Bitcoin is supposed to be a *public, decentralized and open-source* database. That means that everybody can join the system, there is no central entity -like a bank- that governs the system and the source code of the programm is publicly available. 

Since everybody in the network has the same rights and there is no central entity, everybody has its own copy of the database. Note that this means, that also everything that is stored in the blockchain is available for everyone. The common misconception that transactions on the blockchain are anonymous are thereby false. The system is rather transparent.

So let's have a look at how a blockchain works!

# What is a Hash?
Hashes are an important concept for understanding how a BC works. A hash function is a mathematical function/ an algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. So whatever we use as input for a hash function, the output will always have the same format. The output of a hash function is called a hash. 

There are many types of hash functions, one of them are cryptographic hash functions. As the name states they are used in cryptography. Cryptographic hash functions have special properties. 
  1) They are *deterministic*. That means that a certain input will always produce the same output.
  2) They are *one-way functions* which means, that it is easy to calculate the output of the functions for a certain input, but it is really hard to find the input for a given output.
  3) They are supposed to be *collision-free*. That means that there shouldn't be two different inputs that map to the same hash.  Since there are endless possibilities of inputs and only a fixed number of possible outputs, there will always be some collisions. But modern hash functions are so sophisticated that the probability of two inputs mapping to the same hash is close to zero.
  
###### KECCAK-256
**KECCAK-256** is a hash function that is part of the **SHA-3** family. **SHA-3** stands for *Secure Hash Algorithm 3* and is an established standard for hash functions. **KECCAK-256** is interesting for us since it is used by Ethereum, the BC we will focus on in this introduction. The number 256 in the name stands for the size of a resulting hash of that function. So every hash produced by this function is 256 **bit** long. *bit* is the abbreviation of ***bi**nary digi**t*** and is the basic unit for modern computer systems. Every bit can either be *0* or *1*. Since **KECCAK-256** is using 256 bit, it has **2^256** possible hashes as output for the algorithm. 

To understand how big this number is, here is a little analogy: 2^256 is about 10^168. It is estimated that the whole universe has 10^82 atoms in it. So we could hash every atom in the universe with this function and we still wouldn't have used all possilbe hashes. Therefore the probability of a collision is also unimaginably small.

Since it would take up a lot of space to display and would be hard to read a combination of 256 1s and 0s, we shorten it by using numbers and letters to display hashes. Here are some hashes, so that you know how they look like:

```
"test"  - 9c22ff5f21f0b81b113e63f7db6da94fedef11b2119b4088b89664fb9a3cb658
"Test"  - 85cc825a98ec217d960f113f5f80a95d7fd18e3725d37df428eb14f880bdfc12
"Test1" - d283f3979d00cb5493f2da07819695bc299fba34aa6e0bacb484fe07a2fc0ae0
```

As you can see, the slightest change to the input changes the whole output. Go ahead and [try it yourself](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html)!

# What is a block?
So now that you know what a hash is and how they are generated we can look into what a *block* is. A block basically constists of 5 things:
- Two hashes
- A block number
- Block data
- A nonce


I will explain each of those in detail, so don't worry :)

###### Hash
There are two hashes in every block. First there is an 'old' hash that represents the value of the last block before it. The other one is calculated by a combination of the 'old' hash, block number, block data and the nonce as input. Note that this hash will serve as the 'old' hash in the next block.

###### Block number
Since a BC will have a lot of blocks, we need a way to identify and distinguish them from each other. This is the block number. It starts with zero and increases by 1 block by block. Ethereum currently reached block number 4,3 million.

###### Block Data
The data part of a block is basically the information we want to store in a block. As you probably know **Ethereum** is one of the most popular blockchains available today. It is used to transfer ETH, a *digital currency*. So if **A**lice would like to send **1ETH** to **B**ob, that information would be stored in the data section of a block.

###### Nonce
*Nonce* stands for *number once used*. The block number and the data we want to store in a block are sort of fixed values. The block number always depends on the previous block and therefore can't be changed. The block data could be changed, but then we would change the information we store in the block. And we don't want to do that. So if we want to change the hash of a block, we need another variable that can get changed. This is the purpose of the nonce. Why we would want to change the hash of a block I'll explain later. For now just remember that the nonce is the part of a block that will decide, how the hash of a block looks like.

# Validating and Signing
Let's get back to **A**lice and **B**ob. As we said, **A**lice wants to send 1ETH to **B**ob and that transaction will be stored in a block. But how do we know if **A**lice even has 1ETH? Somebody needs to **validate** if **A**lice owns in fact 1ETH. That is what **miners** do. They iterate through every block of the blockchain and by processing all of **A**lice's transactions (in- and outgoing), how much ETH she owns.

But why would anyone volunteer and do all that work? Well for every block they *mine*, they are allowed to add a transaction to grant themselves a certain amount of ETH. Also, if you want your transaction to be processed faster, you can pay the miner a transaction fee to prioritize your transaction to be added to the next block.

So miners profit from validating blocks. But how do we make sure they really do their job and not verify false transactions? And who decides which miner gets the reward for a block?  Ethereum uses *Proof of Work* to solve this problem.

The Ethereum network sets requirements to the way a valid hash can look like. So for example, the requirement could be that the hash has to start with four zero's. Therefore the following hash would **not** fulfill the requirements of the blockchain:

```
c89efdaa54c0f20c7adf612882df0950f5a951637e0307cdcb4c672f298b8bc6 //hash with no 4 leading zeros
```

On the other hand, this hash would be accepted by the blockchain:
```
0000a3074287b2b33e975468ae613e023e478112530bc19d4187693c13943445 //hash with 4 leading zeros
```

But how can a miner produce a hash with four leading zeros? Do you remember nonces? We said that the nonce is the only thing in a block a miner can change. And by changing the nonce he changes the hash of that block. The miner will now put effort in finding a nonce that will result in a hash with four leading zeros. There is no formula to calculate such nonce. It is only possible to find them through trial and error. Since this problem is quite hard for miners, it proofs that they took a lot of effort to find the nonce. Actually that effort is so high (and expensive) that it is not attractive for the miner to cheat anymore. The process of finding a valid nonce is also called *signing the block*.

This also solves the question, which miner is allowed to mine the block and therefore claim the reward. They basically race and who finds the fitting nonce first gets the reward. Every other person in the network can easily test if the block is valid by recalculating the hash.

# Wallets and Smart contracts
So **A**lice wants to send some ETH to **B**ob. But how does she or the blockchain know who **B**ob is on the network? If you have an account at a regular bank, you usually get an *IBAN*, that you can give to people so they know where to send money. 

With the BC it is similar. Once you joined the network you can create as many *wallets* as you like. Wallets are like bank accounts. A wallet can receive funds and the owner of the account can send funds to other wallets. Easy.
Technically, wallets are an *asymmetric crypto system*. Without going into much detail, this means you create two keys: 

-A **public key** which is like your *IBAN*. This is a key you can send to everyone without worrying. 

-A **private key** which is used to unlock your account. You can compare this to the password of your 	bank account. Only you should know this and if anyone else gets that information, well...your money is most likely gone.

Now, there is a second type of account on Ethereum. Those are called **Smart Contracts**. Smart contracts are very similar to wallets. They also have a public key where you can send transactions to. They also can store funds on them and they also can send funds to other accounts. The only difference is, that those accounts are not controlled and managed by a person with the private key, **but by computer code stored in the account**.

The computer code of smart contracts is written in **Solidity**, a programming language espeacially designed for Ethereum. It has a similar syntax to *JavaScript* and is thereby easy to learn if you have some experience in web development. It's most important feature and big difference to Bitcoin's scripting language is that it is *turing-complete*. *Turing completeness* means that it is possible to solve every algorithmic problem possible, assuming you have enough memory / computing power.
